# Snake AI Game

Welcome to the Snake AI Game! This project is a reinforcement learning-based implementation of the classic Snake game, where an AI agent learns to play the game by itself.

## Introduction

The Snake AI Game is a Python-based project that uses deep reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI agent to play the Snake game. The agent learns to navigate the game environment, avoid obstacles, and collect food to grow its snake. The game is implemented using the PyTorch library for machine learning and the Pygame library for game development.

## Installation

To run the Snake AI Game, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pygame
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy pygame matplotlib
```

## Usage

To start the game, run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

The game will start, and the AI agent will begin training itself. You can observe the agent's progress by watching the game window and the plot of the agent's scores.

## How it Works

The Snake AI Game uses a deep reinforcement learning approach to train the AI agent. The agent's state is represented by a vector of 11 values, which include information about the snake's direction, the presence of obstacles, and the location of the food relative to the snake's head.

The agent uses a neural network model to predict the Q-values for each possible action (move left, move right, or move straight). The agent selects actions based on a combination of exploration (random moves) and exploitation (moves based on the predicted Q-values).

The agent's memory is stored in a deque data structure, and the agent is trained using a technique called experience replay. During training, the agent samples a batch of experiences from its memory and uses them to update the neural network's weights using gradient descent.
