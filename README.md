# Snake-AI
This project features a Snake game where the snake learns to navigate and survive using reinforcement learning techniques, particularly the Q-Learning algorithm. QTrainer manages the training process, updating the snake's Q-values based on its experiences within the game.

#Key Features:
Learning Algorithm: Q-Learning is employed to help the snake optimize its movements by learning from rewards and penalties.

Training Manager: QTrainer oversees the snake's training process, updating its learning based on its interactions within the game.

Game Interface: Built with pygame, the game offers a visual representation where users can interact with the snake's learning progress.

Learning Progress Visualization: Using matplotlib, the project generates plots that demonstrate how the snake's learning evolves over time.
